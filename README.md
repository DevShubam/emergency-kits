## 🗒️ What to Include in the Notes & Additional Information Section

The second page of this Emergency Kit is intentionally left blank so **you can customize it** based on your personal setup. Below is a list of ideas and prompts to help you fill it out meaningfully — either using a PDF editor or just handwriting it after printing.

---

### 🔓 Emergency Access 

If you’ve set up Bitwarden’s Emergency Access feature, you can include:

- Names and emails of your trusted contacts
- Access levels (View or Takeover)
- Waiting periods for each contact

---

### 💾 Backup & Recovery Locations

Write down where your vault or related files are backed up and how to access them:

- USB labeled “Emergency” in home office drawer
- Cloud backup: Google Drive → Emergency Documents → `vault-backup.zip`
- Password to decrypt the backup
- Name of encryption tool used (e.g., VeraCrypt, 7-Zip, Picocrypt)

*Note: You'll also need to write your cloud storage login down if you store a backup on cloud storage. I usually don't recommend storing the vault backup on cloud storage. A USB drive or even two should be fine*

### 📱 Device Information

Helpful if you or someone needs to access your devices in a crisis:

- Phone unlock code
- Laptop/desktop login password
- Where your hardware security keys are stored (e.g., YubiKey in top drawer)
- Notes about any trusted devices already logged into your Bitwarden account

---

### 🔐 2FA & Authenticator Info

Clarify how your 2FA is set up and how to recover it:

- Where your 2FA seed phrases / backup codes are stored
- If you use an app like Ente Auth, you can write down your login information

---

### 🧂 Password Customization / Peppering

If you use a “pepper” (secret addition to your passwords), write down:

- What the pepper is (e.g., birth year, symbol, etc.)
- Where it’s added (beginning / end)
- Example password + pepper for clarity

---

### ✉️ Other Stuff (Email, etc)

- Email account login and recovery options
- Other information for family
